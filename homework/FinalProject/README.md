## Remember 2048 game? 
If not, thereÂ´s a quick recap: 
<d1>
  <dd>2048 is a game where theres a 4x4 matrix with tiles that has even numbers. 
The goal is to reach a tile with a value of 2048.
First you start with a sole tile of value 2, then by moving that tile back and forth it appears another tile with value 2 as well.
If 2 tiles are in the same axis, and there is no tiles between them, by making a movement in that axis the two tiles will add together.
